Control and Customize the WordPress Toolbar - change/enhance the colors and styles, hide menus and buttons, change the text next to your username.

== Description ==

Control and Customize the WordPress Toolbar. Toolbar Remixed allows you to change the style and functionality of the WordPress Toolbar. You can choose from black (similar to the default WordPress toolbar colors), blue, or grey colors, and the toolbar style is enhanced with CSS3 box shadows and gradients to make it stand out even more. Give Toolbar Remixed a try instead of disabling the WordPress toolbar, making it useful and stylish. 

Features
* Customize the colors of the WordPress toolbar (Black,Blue,Grey)
* Hide menus and buttons that appear by default in the WordPress toolbar such as the My Sites menu, the WordPress logo menu, the Comments button, the New Content and Edit buttons, the Updates button, the Search box, and the Site Name menu. 
* Hide BuddyPress menus that appear under the User Menu on the far right side - Activity, Blogs, Friends, Groups, etc. can all be hidden to clean up the WordPress toolbar to make it easier for users to find what they need fast and with style.
* Change the text that appears in the user menu of the WordPress toolbar when you login. Usually it says "Howdy, username" but you can change it to the name of your site or "Hi, username" or "Yo, username" or whatever works for your site.
* Hide the WordPress toolbar completely for logged out users (no javascript or fancy tricks, just php that removes default WordPress styles and javascripts to hide it for all logged out users)

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Why didn't anything happen after I activated the plugin? =
Toolbar Remixed allows you to change more than the styles, so by default the WordPress defaults styles are left on until the user changes them in the Settings -> Toolbar Remixed Free page. Turn ON the Toolbar Styles, then select a color and save the options to see the updated Toolbar Remixed styles.
