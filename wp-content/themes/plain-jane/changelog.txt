Theme review Suggested the following changes which have been carried out:
Changed readme.txt with correct theme name for copyright
Got rid of the confusing license part on the terms and conditions page of my website which did not relate to WordPress themes

Escaped user entered data in header.php for home_url and bloginfo
Removed php flush from header
removed css and js files which were not being enqueued
Removed IE6 checks in header

Changed header file with correct respond js for Bootstrap (html5shiv.js and respond.min.js)
Added conditional for full page display if on a bbpress page to the header || class_exists('bbPress') && is_bbpress()
Changed CSS - h1 entry title size.

1.4
Forgot to update footer with corresponding || class_exists('bbPress') && is_bbpress()- updated now
Fixed matching conditional statements for header and footer (full page or left column page layout)

1.5
The Heading color is tough to read with a red background- fixed with #000
Need styling for the navigations of the gallery - fixed so don't go over the image.
The live preview for site title doesn't seems to work in customize, nor does it refresh. Fixed by adding class="site-title" to the <h1> tag
Changed copyright notice in readme.txt
Removed headers folder in images folder of theme as not used.
The videos need a proper width or an alignment -added content width in function.php and recommended css from http://codex.wordpress.org/Content_Width
The chat, quote and the link post needed padding
The sidebar image for text widget overflows- added rule in stylesheet for div.well img
Removed logged out sidebar widget from header.php and functions.php- not needed
enqueued the respond.min.js and html5shiv.js in functions.php conditionally

1.6
Added class to the H1 tag class="site-title" and got the colour change to work
Declared content width at the top of functions.php and corrected to the right width 828.
Images in text widget areas fixed with setting max-width css property

1.7
Changed Screenshot

1.8
Issue: It is not needed to register internal styles and enqueue it after that- fixed in functions.php

1.9
I was testing with the beta buddypress without bbpress active and noticed the profile pages were not full width- so I have fixed this adding bp_is_user() to the statements in header.php and footer.php.(See http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/template-tag-reference/ for more information on tags).
Added a css override for td.label in style.css so the labels show up on the profile pages for buddypress

2.0
Noticed that member pages if using buddypress were not ful width so have added || function_exists('bp_is_active') && bp_is_current_component( 'members' ) to header and footer files to fix this.
Changed style sheet rules to fit better with bootstrap styles on the links and colours for post formats.

2.1
Added missing images into images folder that were referenced in the style.css
Fixed some minor HTML validation errors in public-subpages-4-column.php and public-subpages.php, deleted the skip to content anchor link.
